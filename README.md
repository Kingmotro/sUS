# sUS V1
[Preview link](http://mark-eriksson.com/work/projects/sUS)

A PHP usersystem.

Originally built in 2012, sUS is a PHP usersystem heavily dependant on the Bootstrap and jQuery libraries.

A lot of code is expected to be outdated by now, at the time I built it, I was still using `mysql_` database functions, so it just goes to show how old it really is.

## Features
1. OOP PHP
2. Bootstrap
3. jQuery
4. Custom PHP classes
